## Description

This project is a simple binary message encoding scheme designed and implemented for use in a signaling protocol. The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate the exchange of messages between peers in a real-time communication application.

## Message Model

The message model is defined as follows:

* A message can contain a variable number of headers and a binary payload.
* Headers consist of name-value pairs, where both the names and values are ASCII-encoded strings.
* Header names and values are limited to 1023 bytes each, independently.
* A message can have a maximum of 63 headers.
* The message payload is limited to 256 KiB.
  
Header Encoding
Headers are encoded as follows:

``` 
[Header Length (1 byte)][Header Name (variable length)][Header Value (variable length)]
```

The header length field indicates the total length of the header name and value. The maximum length of a header is 1023 bytes.

Message Format
The entire message structure is organized as follows:

```
[Number of Headers (1 byte)][Header 1][Header 2]...[Header N][Payload]
```
The number of headers field indicates the total count of headers in the message. Headers are then followed by the binary payload. The maximum number of headers allowed is 63, and the payload size is limited to 256 KiB.

Installation
This project doesn't require installation as it is a conceptual design and doesn't involve any code implementation. However, you can integrate this binary message encoding scheme into your real-time communication application's signaling protocol by following the specifications mentioned above.

Usage
To use this binary message encoding scheme in your application, follow the message model and encoding scheme guidelines mentioned in this README. Implement the encoding and decoding logic on both the sending and receiving ends of your real-time communication application. Ensure that you adhere to the defined limits on header lengths, payload size, and the number of headers.

Binary Message Encoding Scheme
Description
This project implements a simple binary message encoding scheme to be used in a signaling protocol for passing messages between peers in a real-time communication application.

Message Model
The message model follows these rules:

A message can contain a variable number of headers and a binary payload.
Headers consist of name-value pairs, where both the names and values are ASCII-encoded strings.
Header names and values are limited to 1023 bytes each, independently.
A message can have a maximum of 63 headers.
The message payload is limited to 256 KiB.
Encoding Scheme
The binary message encoding scheme is designed to ensure efficient message representation for transmission and parsing.

## Header Encoding

Headers are encoded as follows:

[Header Length (1 byte)][Header Name (variable length)][Header Value (variable length)]
The header length field indicates the total length of the header name and value. The maximum length of a header is 1023 bytes.

## Message Format

The entire message structure is organized as follows:

[Number of Headers (1 byte)][Header 1][Header 2]...[Header N][Payload]
The number of headers field indicates the total count of headers in the message. Headers are followed by the binary payload. The maximum number of headers allowed is 63, and the payload size is limited to 256 KiB.
